OSM Maintenance will allow you to put your WordPress site in Maintenance Mode.

== Description ==

OSM Maintenance will allow you to put your WordPress site in Maintenance Mode so you can upgrade files without fear of bringing your site down.

It works by blocking all IP Addresses except for a specific whitelist that you set.

== Installation ==

To install the OSM Maintenance plugin:

1. Upload `osm-maintenance/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to the OSM Maintenance page by clicking the 'OSM Maintenance' Menu Item at the bottom of the main WordPress Menu
4. Manage IP Addresses by adding/removing them from the whitelist

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work to set an entire Multisite into Maintenance Mode? =

Yes! When you network activate the plugin, all the sites in that network will go into Maintenace Mode. 

= How do I add IP Addresses to all the sites in my network without going through each individually? =

Go to the Network Admin Dashboard -> OSM Maitenance page. From there any IP Address you had or remove will overwrite the individual sites' settings.
